# About

This website is based on [this Hugo template](https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template) for [logseq-schrodinger](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger). I've also forked the [logseq-schrodinger plugin](https://github.com/lezuber/logseq-schrodinger), simplified the code there a bit and added support for my custom logseq property `type`. `type` is a reserved word in Hugo, so I just add my object `type` to the list of `tags` in Hugo.

This modified `template` only displays Blogposts that have the tag `Blogpost`. That way, I can have a cleaned up set of blogposts, but also publish my evergreen notes which are relevant to the blogs content.
