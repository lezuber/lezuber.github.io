So, each of this choices has an opportunity cost, as all linked notes compete for your attention in a world of limited time.\nFor that reason, one should always make sure that a given link adds real value to the reader. However, an automatically generated backlink does not necessarily add the same value as the original link.\nThe reason for this is that links get their real power by having a context. A context means a written explanation what the reader can expect under a given link, and why following it might be beneficial in a given context. This way can often make the decision to follow a link often just out of the context. Automatically generated backlinks however do not have such context.\nOn the other hand, not having a backlink at all does also have a cost. They reduce the that valuable connections get lost. Hence, the argument of limited time also can be used to stress the fact that imperfect linking might be more valuable that none.\nTakeaway:\nMake linking as thoughtful as possible. If possible, always add a short description to the connection. That way both links, and their generated backlink become easier to understand. See how readable they can become this way: Related Notes backlinks are a key technique used in the Zettelkasten Method method, but have a opportunity cost.

The only problem: he neither had a PhD nor Habilitation. So, he wrote both in less than a year! How could he be so productive?\nOne might ask, how such a tool can be useful for someone not following a scholar career. Still, writing down ones knowledge in a structured, well organised way can have tremendous benefits in ones life. Not only helps the note-taking process significantly both for comprehension and memorisation of learnings.\nBut also, imagine having a second brain of all your knowledge accessible at your fingertips. Hence, such a method can have a huge benefit for every knowledge-worker, for everyone proceeding a career that involves lifetime learning.\nHowever, most classic note-taking approaches have tremendous flaws. Everyone knows the feeling of not either not understanding a note written a long time ago, not finding it, or even forgetting its existence.\nThe key problem is that most approaches do not reflect the way our brain works.\nDoes your brain think in nested folder structures? Do you go back in time on a long mental timeline, when you search for knowledge?\nThe Zettelkasten method divides your knowledge into more temporary notes, and very well organised permanent notes which are stored in an efficiently linked way. Having a graph like structure of permanent notes allows to create, and later find, connections between ideas and thoughts that would never be possible in a more classical approach.\nTemporary notes are divided as follows:\nðŸŒ³ Evergreen\nðŸ’­ Fleeting Note\nðŸ“š Literature Notes\nðŸ’ª Project Notes\nðŸŒ³ Evergreen (also called permanent notes) are the holy grail of the Zettelkasten method. They consist of all notes that are supposed to last a lifetime.\nWhile creating new Evergreens, an important step is to think and search for other related nodes in the Zettelkasten and link to them, so that the graph / garden of Zettel is steadily growing interconnected.\nFurther, it often makes sense to create Implicit Nodes by Backlinking to have another dimension to explore the graph.\nHowever, it is always important to use Linking with cation, as each Link and Backlink has a opportunity cost. -\u0026gt; Backlinks - Harmful or helpful\nMissing pieces in this note (WIP):\nðŸ“š Literature Notes\nOverview of the currently relevant PKM tools\nUsing templates efficiently in PKMs\nSources Das Zettelkasten Prinzip / How to take smart notes\nAndy Matuschak\u0026rsquo;s public zettelkasten\n","permalink":"https://lezuber.github.io/pages/zettelkasten-method/","summary":"The Zettelkasten, coined by Niklas Luhmann, is a note-taking method to transform information of any source into a personal, lifetime knowledge graph.\nAs an inspirational example, at one point in his life he was offered a full professorship position as a result of his impressive work to that date.
