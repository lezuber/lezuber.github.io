It\u0026rsquo;s important to be as narrow as possible, while still capturing the entirety of the thing.\nI call these atomic notes evergreen notes, as they are supposed to have value to me for the rest of my life. They are very similar to \u0026ldquo;Zettel\u0026rdquo; in the Zettelkasten Method.\nThe Atomicity of Evergreen Notes is the beauty of a Knowledge Garden. Ideally, these links should show you surprising connections between notes that you did not expect because you did not have them in your active memory anymore.\nHow I manage my evergreen notes Each evergreen note in my Logseq graph has the special type:: 🌳 Evergreen Note property. This helps me distinct them from all other types of notes I take. Especially as I use Bidirectional Links for many other things as well, I want to be able to also filter my relations and graph, so that I can explore only these special notes while thinking. I plan to add some additional features to Logseq to improve the differentiation between different types of notes. #someday Related Notes Backlinks are supercharged links which I use to link my evergreen notes.

It\u0026rsquo;s much more fluid. It creates links between individual, atomic thoughts like memories, ideas and concepts. These links are very powerful to jump between very different areas of your memory. What if we could replicate this linking in our notes as well - creating your second brain that works just like your main one, like a friend helping you to organise your thoughts.\nThe Zettelkasten, coined by Niklas Luhmann, is a note-taking approach to transform information of any source into your personal, lifetime knowledge graph - linking your ideas together just like your brain does.\nTo make this possible, it is crucial to keep every note atomic, see also Atomicity of evergreen notes. Personally, I call my very similar kind of notes 🌳 Evergreen Notes.\nBut the true power of such notes is their linking. There is no explicit hierarchy. Notes are linked to one another, in my case using Backlinks. That way, a beautiful Knowledge Graph is implicitly being created.\nHowever, not all notes I take are that atomic and polished. And they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be! Typically, a Zettelkasten system contains other types of notes as well. But those notes should be kept separate from your Evergreen notes. My adoption of the Zettelkasten system uses primarily the following types of notes:\n🌳 Evergreen Notes as outlined above.\n💭 Fleeting Notes for thoughts I want to write down, but don\u0026rsquo;t have a particular structure or objective. Mostly, this category consists of one Journal Note per day. That way, I create a written, connected memory of my fleeting thoughts.\n💪 Project Notes for all notes that are sort of fleeting, but have a clear shared objective I can group them to.\n📚 Literature Notes for structured summaries of any type of media I consume. Not only written things like 📖 Books or 🧑‍💻 Blogpost s, but also e.g. 🎬 Movies, 🎙Podcasts and 🧑‍🏫 Courses.\nSources \u0026amp; Inspirations https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\nAndy Matuschak\u0026rsquo;s public zettelkasten\n","permalink":"https://lezuber.github.io/pages/zettelkasten-method/","summary":"Your brain does not sort knowledge in a hierarchy like folders or categories.
