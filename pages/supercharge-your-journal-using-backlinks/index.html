Personally, I’m often surprised about the weirdness of jumps my mind does between seemingly completely unrelated areas.\nYesterday, for example, I was chatting with my friend Peter about challenges in math education in elementary school. Suddenly, I wanted to talk about a guy we met at dinner the other day. First, it felt completely out of context. But after a short moment, I recalled that this guy actually graduated in mathematics! On top of that, I then recalled the dinner I met him together with the friend I was chatting with at this very moment! So there were even two connections in my brain leading to this thought! I thought that we really should continue this conversation with that guy.\nMost likely, you can relate to the intuition that memories are connected in seemingly weird, sometimes surprising ways. Even when these jumps seem unrelated at first sight - usually in retrospect, I’m very aware of the intermediate jumps my brain has done to connect memories in exciting ways.\nHow is your journal organized? This post is not intended as a motivation to start journalling, but in a nutshell, journaling helps me tremendously to reflect on my life on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nFor the most part, I used to rarely revisit my entries after writing them. The main point always was the process of taking time to reflect. Writing thoughts down just helps me a lot with that.\nNonetheless, I really enjoy exploring some of my entries randomly here and there. It gives me some form of peace and thankfulness for what great memories I have experienced. It also sometimes reignites ideas I had in the past but have forgotten about. I wondered, how could I have these moments more often.\nWhat if there would be a better way to explore my “second brain” of memories? Following them only along the time axis did not feel natural to me. It’s not how my main brain explores memories. What about you?\nThere might be a better way Imagine you could discover your journal not only on the time-axis, but also by places you’ve visited, movies you have watched, or persons you have met. Imagine for example you could click on a person in your journal entry, and then see all memories you share with that person - having a list of all places you’ve visited together all shared friends, and all topics you’ve discussed together in the past.\nOne great fact is that you can have all these features with practically no additional effort on top of your existing journaling routines. The only new concept for this to work is just intuitively linking notes together.\nLet’s start with an example. Please stick with me through this, I’ll explain to you afterwards exactly how I easily achieve the linking that I’ve done in the following:\nComing back to my chat with Peter, I briefly wrote in my Journal about the dinner we were having at a fantastic restaurant, our ideas on elementary math education, and the idea to talk about these thoughts with Michael, the guy I’ve met with a mathematics degree.\nWhile writing this, I intuitively ask myself: “What are ways I want to discover this memory in the future?”. In this case:\nPeter, as the conversation, was with him, and so that I can answer questions like:\na) “What was again the name of the great restaurant I had dinner with Peter the other day?”\nb) “What were the topics I have talked with Peter about in the last few months?” - So that I’ll have all my memories with him in one place.\nThe phrase “restaurant”, so that I can find this restaurant automatically on my restaurant note.\nA tag like Elementary Math Education, to remember this conversation when I think about this topic again\nMichael - Usually I quickly open the note of a person before I meet with them again. This link is created so that I will be reminded to talk with him about this when I meet him again. If I don’t meet him again, this “task” will not bother me ever again. It’s completely offloaded out of my brain.\nIn practice, deciding what I want to link happens intuitively and pretty much instant. I don’t do this as a second step after writing my journal. With the right tool, I can create all these connections on the fly with nearly no additional effort.\nFurther, think of journal entries not as complete stories, but more like entry gates to your passive memory - just like how photos can send you back in time. Often bullet points are more than enough. Here is my entry:\nWithin just three lines of journaling, I was able to create quite a few valuable links in my second brain. They allow me to discover my memory in completely new ways in the future. Have a look, for example, how this memory now is discoverable in my “memory of things I’ve done with Peter”:\nSometimes I explain this note-taking technique as my “friends CRM system”. But it’s so much more than that. Recall, that I can discover this memory not only via Peter and Michael. I can also discover it when I explore my memories of Ramen, Bali, Elementary Math Education, and MOOCs!\nLet’s now show you how you can have the same supercharged journaling features with minimal effort.\nCreate Links on the fly For this to work, you’ll want a note-taking app that supports Implicit Notes by Backlinking. What that means is twofold:\nFirst, you have to be able to create a new note on the fly while typing. The tools I’ll recommend all allow this by hitting `` on your keyboard.\nSecond, you should be able to create new notes on the fly, like New Person in the above video, without having to switch contexts. You can add more information to that note later if you want to. But you don’t have to! By having the list of all mentions linking to a keyword (see e.g. Peter’s page we saw earlier), the given note/object is getting defined implicitly over time.\nTools supporting this approach Here is a lit of three great tools which support this journaling approach\nRemNote\nBest cloud based solution\nBest for non-tech people who not want to / cannot deal with Markdown files\nA daily note for your journal is supported really well\nLogseq\nBest local solution, but can be synced via iCloud / Dropbox / GDrive\nBest outliner app -\u003e everything is a bullet point, which allows nesting your thoughts, but annoys some people.\nObsidian\nBest non-outliner app\nA daily note for journaling purposes can be created like this.\nRelated 🌳 Evergreen Notes: Implicit Notes by Backlinking\nBacklinks - Harmful or helpful\n","wordCount":"1153","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-10-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-10-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lenz Zuber"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://lezuber.com/pages/supercharge-your-journal-using-backlinks/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lenz Zuber","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lezuber.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://lezuber.com accesskey=h title="Lenz Zuber (Alt + H)">Lenz Zuber</a>
