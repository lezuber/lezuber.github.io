A bi-directional link has *social awareness* - **it knows about other pages or 'nodes' that point to it**, and can make them visible on both sides of the link. This turns out to be an extremely powerful tool in PKM-Systems to navigate to ones Knowledge Garden.

[Implicit Nodes by Backlinking]({{< ref "/pages/Implicit Nodes by Backlinking" >}}) is supercharging this ability even further, by creating nodes in the Knowledge Graph even when they have no content yet. Then, they are "just" a overview of all backlinks referring to this page.

To the best of my knowledge, Roam was the first majorly adopted tool supporting this feature as one of its main features . It made many people aware of this superpower and influenced many tools to come. The idea is not new however. It goes all the way back to 1945, when Vannevar Bush envisioned a [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) machine.
