title: Implicit Nodes by Backlinking
lastMod: 2022-10-04

A very powerful technique to organise the knowledge is to steadily create backlinks to nodes which don't even exist yet. This can include things like Persons, Places, Movies, Concepts, and many more.
By using the same backlinks in many different occurrences, the node becomes defined *implicitly*.

This effect requires [Contextual backlinks]({{< ref "/pages/Contextual backlinks" >}}), a simple list of backlinks wonâ€™t implicitly define a node very effectively. You need to be able to see the context around the backlink to understand whatâ€™s being implied.
