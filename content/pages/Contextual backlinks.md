A contextual backlink displays not only a reference from another location, but the specific context around that reference - for instance, the page of a book or the referencing paragraph. That way it's much easier to grasp why a link has been created without following the link right away.

One problem with this feature is, that this **discourages clever ways of linking notes which explicitly state why the connection is meaningful**.
