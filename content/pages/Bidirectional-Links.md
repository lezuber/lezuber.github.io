A bi-directional link has *social awareness* - **it knows about other pages or 'nodes' that point to it**, and can make them visible on both sides of the link. This turns out to be an extremely powerful tool in PKM-Systems to navigate to ones Knowledge Garden.

[Implicit Notes by Backlinking]({{< ref "/pages/Implicit-Notes-by-Backlinking" >}}) is supercharging this ability even further, by creating nodes in the Knowledge Graph even when they have no content yet. Then, they are "just" a overview of all backlinks referring to this page.

To the best of my knowledge, Roam was the first majorly adopted tool supporting this feature as one of its main features . It made many people aware of this superpower and influenced many tools to come. The idea is not new however. It goes all the way back to 1945, when Vannevar Bush envisioned a [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) machine.



## About my usage in Logseq

  + As I use the linking-feature quite extensively for two different things, I'm steadily thinking about how to make the difference between them more distinct:

    + Links between [ðŸŒ³ Evergreen Note]({{< ref "/pages/Evergreen-Note" >}}) which are the most valuable links to follow.

    + Links used to add a relation of the given context to Keywords I would like to have as edges in my knowledge-graph e.g. Places, Persons, Tools, Days (by linking from Journal entries)

  + I haven't  come up with a good solution yet, but will implement a feature for this in [Logseq]({{< ref "/pages/Logseq" >}}) #someday.

## Related Notes

  + Bi-directional Links have an opportunity cost. See: Backlinks - Harmful or helpful

  + [Implicit Notes by Backlinking]({{< ref "/pages/Implicit-Notes-by-Backlinking" >}}) are supercharging this feature.

  + [Contextual backlinks]({{< ref "/pages/Contextual-backlinks" >}}) are a great way displaying them.
