The Zettelkasten, coined by Niklas Luhmann, is a note-taking method to transform information of any source into a personal, lifetime knowledge graph.

As an inspirational example, at one point in his life he was offered a full professorship position as a result of his impressive work to that date. The only problem: *he neither had a PhD nor Habilitation*. S**o, he wrote both in less than a year!** How could he be so productive?

One might ask, how such a tool can be useful for someone not following a scholar career. Still, writing down ones knowledge in a structured, well organised way can have tremendous benefits in ones life. Not only **helps the note-taking process significantly both for comprehension and memorisation of learnings**.

But also, imagine having a second brain of **all your knowledge accessible at your fingertips**. Hence, such a method can have a huge benefit for every knowledge-worker, for everyone proceeding a career that involves lifetime learning.

However, most classic note-taking approaches have tremendous flaws. Everyone knows the feeling of not either not understanding a note written a long time ago, not finding it, or even forgetting its existence.

The key problem is that **most approaches do not reflect the way our brain works**.

Does your brain think in nested folder structures?
Do you go back in time on a long mental timeline, when you search for knowledge?

The Zettelkasten method divides your knowledge into more temporary notes, and very well organised permanent notes which are stored in an efficiently linked way. Having a graph like structure of permanent notes allows to create, and later find, connections between ideas and thoughts that would never be possible in a more classical approach.

Temporary notes are divided as follows:

  + ðŸŒ³ Evergreen

  + ðŸ’­ Fleeting Note

  + ðŸ“š Literature Notes

  + ðŸ’ª Project Notes

ðŸŒ³ Evergreen (also called permanent notes) are the holy grail of the Zettelkasten method. They consist of all notes that are supposed to last a lifetime.

  + While creating new Evergreens, an important step is to think and search for other related nodes in the Zettelkasten and link to them, so that the graph / garden of Zettel is steadily growing interconnected.

  + Further, it often makes sense to create [Implicit Nodes by Backlinking]({{< ref "/pages/Implicit Nodes by Backlinking" >}}) to have another dimension to explore the graph.

  + However, it is always important to use Linking with cation, as each Link and Backlink has a opportunity cost. -> [Backlinks -  Harmful or helpful]({{< ref "/pages/Backlinks -  Harmful or helpful" >}})
