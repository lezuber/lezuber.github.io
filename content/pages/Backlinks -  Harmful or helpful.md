Every linking between notes adds a choice to the future you of additional notes to discover when stumbling over an evergreen note. So, each of this choices has an **opportunity cost**, as all linked notes compete for your attention in a world of limited time.

For that reason, one should always make sure that a given link adds real value to the reader. However, an automatically generated backlink does not necessarily add the same value as the original link.

The reason for this is that links get their real power by having a context. A context means a written explanation what the reader can expect under a given link, and why following it might be beneficial in a given context. This way can often make the decision to follow a link often just out of the context. Automatically generated backlinks however do not have such context.

On the other hand, not having a backlink at all does also have a **cost**. They reduce the that valuable connections get lost. Hence, the argument of limited time also can be used to stress the fact that imperfect linking might be more valuable that none.

Takeaway:

  + Make linking as **thoughtful as possible. If possible, always add a short description to the connection**. That way both links, and their generated backlink become easier to understand.

See how readable they can become this way:
