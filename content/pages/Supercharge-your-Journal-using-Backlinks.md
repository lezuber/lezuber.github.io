Before you start, **take a short moment to ponder about the way your very own brain connects memories.**

## How does your brain connect memories?

Personally, I'm often surprised about the weirdness of  jumps my mind does between seemingly completely unrelated areas.

Yesterday, for example, I was chatting with my friend Peter about challenges in math education in elementary school. Suddenly, I wanted to talk about a guy we met at dinner the other day. First, it felt completely out of context. But after a short moment, I recalled that this guy actually has graduated in mathematics! On top of that, I then recalled the dinner I've met him was together with the friend I was chatting with at this very moment! So there were even two *connections* in my brain leading to this thought! I though that we really should continue this conversation with that guy.

Most likely, you can relate to the intuition that memories are connected in a seemingly weird, sometimes surprising ways. Even when these jumps seem unrelated at first sight - usually in retrospective, I'm very aware of the intermediate jumps my brain has done to connect memories in exciting ways.



## How is your journal organized?

This post is not intended as a motivation to start journalling, but in a nutshell, journaling helps me tremendously to reflect my life on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

For the most part, I used to rarely revisit my entries after writing them. The main point always was the process of taking time to reflect. Writing thoughts down just helps me a lot with that.

Nonetheless, I really enjoy to explore some of my entries randomly here and there. It gives me some form of peace and thankfulness of what great memories I have experienced. It also sometimes reignites ideas I had in the past but have forgotten about. I wondered, how could I have these moments more often?

What if there would be a better way to explore my "second brain" of memories?. Following them only along the time-axis did not feel natural to me. It's not how my main brain explores memories. What about you?



## There might be a better way

Imagine you could discover your journal not only on the time-axis, but also by places you've visited, a movies you have watched, or persons you have met. Imagine for example you could click on a person in your journal entry, and then **see all memories you share with that person** - having a list of all places you've visited together, all shared friends, and all topics you've discussed together in the past.

One great fact is that **you can have all these features with practically no additional effort** on top of your existing journaling routines. The only new concept for this to work is just intuitively linking notes together.

**Let's start with an example.** Please stick with me through this, I'll explain you afterwards exactly how I easily achieve the linking that I've done in the following:

Coming back to my chat with Peter, I briefly wrote in my Journal about the dinner we were having at a fantastic restaurant, our ideas on elementary math education, and the idea to talk about these thoughts with Michael, the guy I've met with a mathematics degree.

While writing this, I *intuitively* ask myself: "What are ways I want to discover this memory in the future?". In this case:

  + **Peter**, as the conversation was with him, and so that I can answer questions like:

    + a) "What was again the name of the great restaurant I had dinner with Peter the other day?"

    + b) "What were the topics I have talked with Peter about in the last few month?" - So that I'll have all memories with him at one place.

  + **The phrase "restaurant"**, so that I can find this restaurant automatically on my **restaurant** note.

  + A *tag* like **Elementary Math Education**, to remember this conversation when I think about this topic again

  + **Michael** - Usually I quickly open the note of a person before I meet with them again. This link is created so that I will be reminded to talk with him about this when I meet him again. If I don't meet him again, this "task" will not bother me ever again. It's completely offloaded out of my brain.

In practice, **this happens pretty much instant**. I don't do this as a second step after writing my journal. With the right tool, **I can create all these connections on the fly with nearly no additional effort.**

Further, think of journal entries not as complete stories, but more like entry gates to your passive memory - just like how photos can send you back in time. **Often bullet points are more than enough.** Here is my entry:

Within just three lines of journaling, I was able to create quite a few valuable links in my *second brain*. They allow me to discover my memory in completely new ways in the future. Have a look, for example, how this memory now is discoverable in my "memory of things I've done with Peter":

Sometimes I explain this note-taking technique as my *"friends CRM system"*. But it's so much more than that. Recall, that I can discover this memory not only via **Peter** and **Michael**. I can also discover it, when I explore my memories about **Ramen, Bali, Elementary Math Education and MOOCs**!



Let's now show you how you can have the same supercharged journaling features with minimal effort.

## Create Links on the fly

For this to work, you'll want a note-taking app that supports [Implicit Notes by Backlinking]({{< ref "/pages/Implicit-Notes-by-Backlinking" >}}). What that means is twofold:

First, you have to be able to create a new note on the fly while typing. The tools I'll recommend all allow this by hitting `` on your keyboard.

![Screen Recording 2022-10-11 at 12.03.43.gif](/assets/screen_recording_2022-10-11_at_12.03.43_1665473732106_0.gif)

Second, you should be able to create new notes on the fly, like `New Person` in the above video, without having to switch context. You can add more information to that note later if you want to. But you don't have to! By having the list of all mentions linking to a keyword (see e.g. Peter's page we saw earlier), the given note/object is getting defined ***implicitly*** over time.



## Tools supporting this approach



I think about expanding the tool landscape to support this even better. Does that sound interesting?

## Outlook: Connect all your other notes in the same way!

A few years ago, I discovered the [Zettelkasten note-taking method](Zettelkasten Method). In short, it is an approach to structure your most important knowledge as a pile of [atomic](Atomicity of Evergreen Notes) notes only describing a single thing as narrow as possible.
