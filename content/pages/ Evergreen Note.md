Taking smart notes while consuming any type of media into ðŸ“š Literature Notes is an already great habit to increase comprehension and recall. But to level up even further, it can be of great value to make a habit out of extracting ones very personal, key insights into short, atomic notes about one single thing. It's important to be as narrow as possible, while still capturing the entirety of the thing.

I call these atomic notes **evergreen notes**, as they are supposed to have **value to me for the rest of my life**. They are very similar to "Zettel" in the [Zettelkasten Method]({{< ref "/pages/Zettelkasten Method" >}}).



The [Atomicity of Evergreen Notes]({{< ref "/pages/Atomicity of Evergreen Notes" >}}) is the beauty of a Knowledge Garden. Ideally, these links should show you **surprising connections** between notes that you did not expect because you did not have them in your active memory anymore.





## How I manage my evergreen notes

  + Each evergreen note in my [Logseq]({{< ref "/pages/Logseq" >}}) graph has the special `type:: [ðŸŒ³ Evergreen Note]({{< ref "/pages/ðŸŒ³ Evergreen Note" >}})` property. This helps me distinct them from all other types of notes I take. Especially as I use [Bidirectional Links]({{< ref "/pages/Bidirectional Links" >}}) for many other things as well, I want to be able to also filter my relations and graph, so that I can explore only these special notes while thinking.
I plan to add some additional features to Logseq to improve the differentiation between different types of notes.  #someday
