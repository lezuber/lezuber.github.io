This turns out to be an extremely powerful tool in PKM-Systems to navigate to ones Knowledge Garden.
Implicit Nodes by Backlinking is supercharging this ability even further, by creating nodes in the Knowledge Graph even when they have no content yet. Then, they are &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; a overview of all backlinks referring to this page.</description></item><item><title>Contextual backlinks</title><link>https://lezuber.github.io/pages/contextual-backlinks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lezuber.github.io/pages/contextual-backlinks/</guid><description>A contextual backlink displays not only a reference from another location, but the specific context around that reference - for instance, the page of a book or the referencing paragraph.</description></item><item><title>Implicit Nodes by Backlinking</title><link>https://lezuber.github.io/pages/implicit-nodes-by-backlinking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lezuber.github.io/pages/implicit-nodes-by-backlinking/</guid><description>A very powerful technique to organise the knowledge is to steadily create backlinks to nodes which don&amp;rsquo;t even exist yet. This can include things like Persons, Places, Movies, Concepts, and many more. By using the same backlinks in many different occurrences, the node becomes defined implicitly.
This effect requires Contextual backlinks, a simple list of backlinks won’t implicitly define a node very effectively. You need to be able to see the context around the backlink to understand what’s being implied.</description></item></channel></rss>
